 * Thrown when a capability has no enabled route, at publish time and at dispatch time alike.

 * (ADR-037): the failure existed either way, and the only choice was whether it was visible.
 * Catching this to route somewhere plausible re-introduces the defect it was raised to remove.
 *
 * <p>It names the capability because whoever has to act on it — an admin publishing a blueprint, an
 * operator reading a failed run — cannot find the missing row from a stack trace.
