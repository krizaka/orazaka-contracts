/**
 * One capability row as a pack declares it (ADR-037 §3.2).
 *
 * <p>Carries both dispatch discriminants of ADR-038, because neither is derivable from the other:
 * {@code routingKey} selects the PROCESS that drains the job and {@code handlerKey} selects the
 * CODE PATH inside it. A declaration with one but not the other describes a job that either reaches
 * no worker or reaches one that cannot run it, which is why both are required rather than
 * defaulted.
 *
 * @param featureKey the capability key, unique in {@code orazaka_capabilities}
 * @param handlerKey the {@code JobExecutor} whose {@code handlerKey()} equals this
 * @param routingKey the AMQP routing key the job is published under
 * @param billableUnit what is metered, {@code null} where the unit belongs to the model
 * @param billableCapability which pricebook row prices it
 * @param inputSchema what a caller MAY PASS, as a JSON Schema — types, {@code required}, defaults
 *     and the {@code format: prose | asset-id} a composer reads to know which of its two holdings
 *     fills an input (ADR-068 §3). This is what {@code payloadTemplate} carried as an untyped
 *     string of {@code ${placeholders}}, which no rule could check (ADR-069)
 * @param outputSchema what a SUCCESSFUL execution publishes, with types. Nothing declared this
 *     before, so every {@code {{steps.<out>.<field>}}} link in every blueprint referenced a field
 *     no contract mentioned — and the one hand-written table that tried was wrong about audio
 *     analysis. {@code {}} means "declares nothing", and a step over it fails the fitness function
 *     rather than passing silently
 * @param latencyClass which LANE its work waits in — INTERACTIVE or BATCH (ADR-067). Read-only from
 *     a pack's point of view: {@code CapabilityRegistryService} overwrites whatever a registration
 *     carries, because a pack that chose its own lane would choose the interactive one and then
 *     everything would be interactive. The platform reclassifies from measured durations
 * @param enabled whether it may be dispatched
