/**
 * The message a producer publishes onto {@code orazaka.jobs} to request asynchronous execution.
 *
 * <p>One record, in one Tier-1 module, because it is a <b>wire contract</b> and it had drifted into
 * two: the conversation service's copy grew {@link #withReservation} and {@link #resolvedModel()}
 * for billing while the job service's copy did not, so the executor was deserialising a shape its
 * own class no longer described (production-readiness audit #17, ADR-037). A contract with two
 * definitions has none.
 *
 * <p>The wire payload stays a generic {@code Map<String, Object>} for (de)serialization and
 * persistence, but business code must read it through the typed "smart payload" accessors below
 * rather than casting raw {@code payload().get(...)} values [ERR-127].
 *
 * @param jobId the id every lifecycle event of this job is keyed by
 * @param userId the opaque actor the work is attributed to; {@code null} for unattributed work
 * @param featureKey the capability to execute — resolved to a queue through {@link
 *     com.orazaka.jobs.domain.port.CapabilityRoutingClient}, never by inspecting this string
 * @param model the model the producer resolved, or {@code "default"} when it resolved none
 * @param payload the capability's arguments; defensively copied
 * @param dataClass what the work's material is, declared by the producer that knows (ADR-065). A
 *     typed component and not a payload key: payload keys under {@code orazaka.} can be written by
 *     an end user through door 1, and a class is not theirs to choose. {@code null} here means the
 *     producer declared nothing — which the job plane refuses rather than reading as STANDARD
