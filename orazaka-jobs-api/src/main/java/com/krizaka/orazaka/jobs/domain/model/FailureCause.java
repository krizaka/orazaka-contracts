/**
 * Why a job failed, <b>declared by whoever failed it</b> — never inferred from its message.
 *
 * <p>The fifth application of AGENTS.md §12. The executor is the only party that knows whether it
 * refused a payload, lost its model, or was stopped by a gate; every consumer downstream of it was
 * reading prose and guessing. ADR-053 reopened the question that {@code ADR-046 §2} closed, for a
 * reason that is not billing: a SENSITIVE pack's audit log could not tell <i>"we protected the
 * user"</i> from <i>"we broke"</i>, because a scope-guard refusal and a model outage arrived
 * identical.
 *
 * <p><b>Two axes decide the vocabulary</b>, and a category exists only when it answers differently
 * on one of them: did the platform do its job correctly, and does the answer say the user was at
 * fault. A third — what an operator must go and fix — is what the audit log needs, and it is why
 * three causes that settle identically are still three.
 *
 * <table>
 *   <caption>The vocabulary, and what each answer commits to</caption>
 *   <tr><th>Cause</th><th>Settles</th><th>Blames the input</th><th>Operator action</th></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link #GUARD_REFUSAL}</td><td><b>yes</b></td><td>no</td><td>none — working as designed</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link #INPUT_INVALID}</td><td><b>yes</b></td><td><b>yes</b></td><td>none</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link #EXECUTOR_FAULT}</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>fix our code</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link #PLATFORM_UNAVAILABLE}</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>restore a dependency</td></tr>
 *   <tr><td>{@link #TIMEOUT}</td><td>no</td><td>no</td><td>capacity, or the bound itself</td></tr>
 * </table>
 *
 * <p><b>The settlement rule is one sentence: we bill for work we performed correctly, and never for
 * our own failure.</b> A gate declining to serve and a payload the executor could not use are both
 * the platform behaving exactly as designed, so the compute already spent is settled. A defect, an
 * absent dependency and a missed deadline are ours, so the whole hold goes back.
 *
 * <p>An earlier draft billed only {@link #INPUT_INVALID}, on the ground that ADR-051 §3 had made a
 * refusal free. That reading does not survive contact with a multi-step run: it makes a refusal
 * free <i>only when it happens first</i>, so an actor's bill would depend on which step an
 * out-of-scope phrase happened to reach — and it made a refusal and a model outage settle
 * identically, which is precisely the confusion this ADR exists to end. Under the rule as written,
 * a refusal that arrives before any work still costs nothing, because nothing was measured.

   * answer — so the work performed before that point was performed correctly. A refusal that
   * arrives before anything ran still costs nothing, because there is nothing to settle.
   *
   * <p>Which gate refused travels as detail, not as a category: an entitlement refusal and a scope
   * refusal are the same event to the saga, and promoting one gate into the vocabulary while the
   * others stay generic is the asymmetry that makes a vocabulary grow without bound.
