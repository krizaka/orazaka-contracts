/**
 * Read side of the job-plane contract: where does this capability's work run?

 * tomorrow anything dispatching a capability a pack brought with it. The mapping lives in one
 * place, {@code orazaka_capabilities}, so a producer never carries a second copy of it.
 *
 * <p><b>Does not degrade.</b> Unlike {@code PackPricingClient}, where an unknown price renders "—",
 * an unresolved route has no acceptable rendering: a step with no route cannot be dispatched
 * anywhere, and picking a queue anyway is the silent misroute this port exists to end. An
 * implementation that cannot answer returns {@link Optional#empty()} and the caller raises {@link
 * com.orazaka.jobs.domain.exception.UnroutableCapabilityException} — the user gets an error instead
 * of a wrong answer.
