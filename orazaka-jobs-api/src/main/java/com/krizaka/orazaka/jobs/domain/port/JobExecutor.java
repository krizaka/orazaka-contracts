/**
 * One capability's execution, in process.
 *
 * <p>The convenience half of the worker SPI. The <b>extension point</b> is the AMQP contract
 * (`docs/WORKER_PROTOCOL.md`): a worker is anything that honours the message contract, in any
 * language, linking nothing — which is already true of the Python media worker. This interface
 * exists for executors that are cheap to run inside the job service rather than as their own
 * process, and it is deliberately not the mechanism (ADR-037 §3.4, ADR-038).
 *
 * <p><b>Discovered, not registered by hand.</b> Implementations are contributed through {@code
 * META-INF/spring/org.springframework.boot.autoconfigure.AutoConfiguration.imports}, exactly as
 * {@code orazaka-interceptors} contributes its pipeline [ERR-122]. An out-of-tree jar on the
 * classpath contributes an executor with no edit to this repository — that is the property this
 * interface exists to provide, and the one its acceptance test asserts.
 *
 * <p><b>Tier-1, and therefore pure.</b> No Spring, no file I/O, no engine types. An implementation
 * may use all three; the contract may not, or an executor could not be written outside a repository
 * that ships the engine.
