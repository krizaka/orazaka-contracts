/**
 * What a worker declares about itself at boot — its {@code worker.yaml}, on the wire.
 *
 * <p>Tier-1 because a worker is <b>anything that honours the message contract</b>, in any language
 * (ADR-037 §3.4). This record is the Java view of a JSON body that the Python media worker posts
 * without linking a single Orazaka class, and it is documented as such in {@code
 * docs/WORKER_PROTOCOL.md}.
 *
 * <p>A worker declares its <b>bindings</b>, never a capability. Naming a capability is what coupled
 * the media worker to one pack and is forbidden by [PACK-002]/[PACK-003]; a binding is a statement
 * about queues, which is the worker's own business.
 *
 * @param name stable identity, the registry's primary key — a restarting worker re-registers rather
 *     than accumulating rows
 * @param family which family of work it serves, joined by name to {@code
 *     orazaka_capabilities.worker_family}
 * @param bindings the routing-key patterns it drains, e.g. {@code job.video.*}
 * @param version the worker's own version, so an operator can see a rolling upgrade
 * @param concurrency how many jobs it will run at once — an input to per-family autoscaling later
