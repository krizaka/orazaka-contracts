/**
 * Who a job runs as, and under what preferences — the Tier-1 half of the execution contract.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this exists rather than the engine's own {@code Context}.</b> The four in-process
 * executors that take a context never read a field from it; they forward it whole into an {@code
 * AiClient} request. Putting the engine's {@code Context} on this port would therefore make Tier-1
 * depend on {@code orazaka-core} — Tier-2 — for a type it only passes through, and an out-of-tree
 * executor written in a repository that does not ship the engine could not implement the interface
 * at all. ADR-037 already recorded the principle: the extension point must not drag the engine
 * behind it.
 *
 * <p>So the shape travels, the engine type does not. The job service maps this onto its own {@code
 * Context} at the boundary — an anti-corruption layer of exactly the kind [ERR-127] asks for.
 * {@code authorities} are plain names for the same reason: the engine's {@code Authority} wrapper
 * is an engine type.
 *
 * @param actorId the opaque actor the work is attributed to
 * @param correlationId the id tying this execution to the conversation or run that asked for it
 * @param preferences execution overrides, including the {@code orazaka.*} keys a producer stamped
 *     into the payload; defensively copied and unmodifiable
 * @param authorities the actor's resolved role names; defensively copied and unmodifiable
